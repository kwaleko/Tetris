# Tetris
Tetris is a classic puzzle game that was created in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov, a Soviet software engineer. The game has been published by several companies for multiple platforms and has become one of the most successful and recognizable video games of all time. In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces, called tetrominoes, which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field. The longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher their score will be. In multiplayer games, players must last longer than their opponents; in certain versions, players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines. Some versions add variations on the rules, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving pieces
In addition I have implemented an autoplayer
